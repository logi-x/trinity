# SCOPE PRIMITIVE
# A note's scope is its top-level folder, already encoded in its note_id
# (the POSIX path relative to BRAIN_PATH, e.g. "02-Permanent/Foo.md").
# `core` is the curated cognitive-fingerprint corpus; everything else is
# mounted on demand. Read / learn / fingerprint each respect scope.
# This is the canonical home for the PURE primitives (no faiss/networkx here);
# the FAISS IDSelector glue lives in scope.py.
# =============================================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scope registry - the "add a new scope TYPE" capability
#
# A scope is a top-level Brain/ folder. Every scope has a KIND that decides how
# the epistemic machinery treats it:
#
#   cognitive - claims / insights. Additive, lifecycle-governed (reflective ->
#               crystallizing -> generative), crystallizable; provenance is one
#               of originated/endorsed/encountered/ai-inferred. The CORE subset
#               (the curated cognitive fingerprint) trains q-values and shapes
#               hubs/centrality. Non-core cognitive folders are encountered
#               material + operational exhaust (read-isolated, learn-gated,
#               fingerprint-excluded by the scope primitive).
#   reference - external facts / records (employees, products, clients,
#               contracts). NOT claims: mutable/overwrite-in-place, provenance
#               `reference`, opted OUT of lifecycle / crystallization / the
#               synthesis pulse, recency beats age. Reference scopes are non-core
#               by construction, so the read-mask / learn-gate / fingerprint-
#               exclusion already cover them for free; the `reference` kind only
#               adds the epistemic opt-out the BDG + crystallize/graduate skills
#               consult (is_reference_scope) and a default `reference` provenance.
#
# Adding a scope = ONE ScopeDef below (built-in) or one register_scope() call
# (a layer/deployment adding its own, e.g. a per-tenant reference scope). The
# derived CORE_FOLDERS / SCOPE_TOKEN_MAP are rebuilt from this list, so the pure
# primitives (resolve_read_scope, is_pure_core, scope_of) never change. Folder
# strings are EXACT (note the spaces in "AI Extracted Notes" - no folder slug).
