"""
Idempotency-key enforcement service (RELIABILITY-006, #525).

Thin orchestration over `db.idempotency_*`. Routers call `begin()` at a trigger
boundary; a replay short-circuits the duplicate, a first-seen key proceeds and
is finalized with `complete()` (or released with `fail()` on dispatch failure).

The "single funnel" (`TaskExecutionService`) is not actually single — sync
`/chat` runs an inline path and `/api/webhooks/{token}` creates no execution at
all — so enforcement lives at each router boundary, backed by this service.

Header is OPTIONAL on chat/task/MCP (absent → no dedup, full back-compat). The
webhook boundary auto-derives a key from `(token, body_hash)` so naive senders
that retry without idempotency awareness are still covered. The scheduler sends
a deterministic key derived from the per-fire execution_id.

      (a concurrent attempt holds the claim) — the sink surfaces a retryable
      409, never a silent success (codex #6).
    - **fresh claim** → yields `g.dedup_enabled=True`; on clean exit `complete()`
      stores `g.snapshot`, on exception `fail()` releases the claim so a failed
      attempt retries.
    - **fail-open** → an absent/invalid execution_id (and no payment_request_id),
      or a claim hiccup, yields a no-op state so the send proceeds without dedup.

    Two scopes:
    - Effect path (messages/voip/share): `effect:{execution_id}`, after
      `resolve_and_validate_execution` confirms ownership.
    - Payment path (Nevermined): `payment:{agent_request_id}` — the native
      token IS the unit; `execution_id` (if given) is only recorded for audit.

    Documented tradeoff: a crash AFTER the claim but BEFORE the provider call
    leaves the row `in_flight`, blocking a re-send for the TTL window
    (at-most-once-with-possible-loss). See the contract doc.
