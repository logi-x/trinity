Agent Monitoring Service (MON-001)

Performs multi-layer health checks on agent infrastructure:
- Layer 1: Docker (container status, resources, restarts, OOM)
- Layer 2: Network (HTTP reachability, latency)
- Layer 3: Business (runtime availability, context usage, error rates)

Health checks run as background tasks and store results in the database.
Alerts are sent via the notification system when status changes.

        #675: this previously filtered to ``status == "running"`` only.
        A stopped / exited / crashed agent was excluded from every
        cycle, so its ``agent_health_checks`` row never refreshed —
        production showed agents stale for *months* (last refresh
        2026-02-23..04-28) while the one running agent stayed fresh.
        That is precisely backwards: a down agent is the case
        monitoring most needs to surface. `perform_health_check`
        already produces a correct "docker exited / unreachable →
        unhealthy" record for a stopped agent (and the #631 dormant
        short-circuit bounds cost for hard-down agents), so we now
        check the whole fleet.

        Note: `perform_fleet_health_check` is already per-agent
        isolated via `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` +
        per-result handling — issue hypothesis #1 (one agent's failure
        short-circuits the fleet) did not hold; the bug was this
        filter, not missing isolation.
